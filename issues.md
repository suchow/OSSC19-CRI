1. The paper includes "Germany" in the list of rich democracies. However, both the 1996 and 2006 data have separate country codes for Germany (East) and Germany (West), and the paper does not state how they should be combined. This analysis combines them by including data from both East and West.

2. The paper includes "United Kingdom" in the list of rich democracies. However, the 1996 data has separate country codes for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the paper does not state how they should be combined. This analysis combines them by including data from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

3. The paper includes "United Kingdom" in the list of rich democracies. However, the 2006 data has a country code only for Great Britain and not Northern Ireland.

4. The paper says that they used listwise deletion, but does not specify at which stage of the analysis the deletion process is performed. If the listwise deletion is peformed over all variables in the combined dataset, then no datapoints survive the procedure. I assume that they perform the deletion only after having removed any column not used in that particular analysis.

5. In the Stata .do file, no version of Stata is specified. My fresh install of Stata did not have a function called "zscore". It appears to be an external package. Found package *! version 2.0.1 SRD & JI 22jul2010 by user zscore and installed it.
